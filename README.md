# CollegeMiniProject

## About the project
The problem was our college website didn't provide any information like notice. 
So, for our college mini project we decided to build a website where your you can get any informations and
you can even post any type of information. But before publishing the info to the main page(i.e. index.php), the info have to be 
verified. All users can vote if the info is legit or not in the verification.php page.


## How to run the CLG updates Project
1. Download the  zip file
2. Extract the file and copy CollegeMiniProject folder
3. Download xampp or wamp server
4. Paste inside root directory(for xampp xampp/htdocs, for wamp wamp/www, for lamp var/www/html)
5. Open PHPMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
6. Create a database with name clgupdates 
7. Import clgupdates.sql file(given inside the zip package in sql file folder)
8. Open the browser (chrome), type localhost/CollegeMiniProject and you should see the index page of the website.
